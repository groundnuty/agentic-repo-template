# agentic-repo-template

A GitHub template repository with sane Claude Code defaults for autonomous work. Four profiles (`info` / `research` / `paper` / `code`) cover knowledge work, technical research, academic paper writing, and code-centric development.

## Quick start

1. On GitHub, click **Use this template → Create a new repository**.
2. Clone your new repo locally.
3. Pick a profile and run the init script:

```bash
./.claude/init.sh info        # knowledge / prose work only
./.claude/init.sh research    # technical research, doc reading
./.claude/init.sh paper       # academic paper writing
./.claude/init.sh code        # code-centric projects
```

The script merges the profile's overlay into `.claude/settings.json`, copies profile-specific rules into `.claude/rules/`, appends profile guidance to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, vendors profile-specific skills into `.claude/skills/`, then removes `.claude/profiles/` and `.claude/init.sh` themselves. Your repo ends up with only the final configuration.

## Profiles at a glance

| Profile | Primary use | Extends |
|---|---|---|
| `info` | reports, document analysis, prose | (base) |
| `research` | technical research, doc reading, no code writing | `info` |
| `paper` | academic paper writing — LaTeX, peer review | `research` |
| `code` | code-centric projects | `info` (not `research`) |

## Profile contents matrix

Every artifact by exact name, one row per item. Cell `✓` means the artifact is present in that profile after running `init.sh`. Items are grouped by surface (plugins / rules / skills / agents / hooks / templates) and within each surface ordered by commonality — items present in all four profiles come first, then items in three, two, one.

### Post-init totals

| Profile | Plugins | Rules | Skills | Agents | Hooks | Templates |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `info` | 8 | 10 | 1 | — | — | 4 |
| `research` | 9 | 13 | 1 | — | — | 4 |
| `paper` | 9 | 21 | 11 | 5 | 3 | 5 |
| `code` | 9 | 14 | 1 | — | — | 4 |

### What's common vs specific at a glance

- **In all four profiles** (base + info): 8 plugins, 10 rules, 1 skill, 4 templates.
- **In three profiles** (`research` + `paper` + `code` — *not* `info`): 1 plugin (`context7`).
- **In two profiles** (`research` + `paper`): 3 rules (`citation-discipline`, `reading-before-editing`, `pdf-processing`).
- **Paper-only**: 8 rules, 10 skills, 5 agents, 3 hooks, 1 template.
- **Code-only**: 4 rules.

### Attribution

The `paper` profile adopts 17 pieces from [pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow) (MIT), 1 from [scunning1975/MixtapeTools](https://github.com/scunning1975/MixtapeTools) (use freely, attribution appreciated), and 1 from [groundnuty/humanizer](https://github.com/groundnuty/humanizer) (git-upstream-sourced, refreshable via `refresh-skills.sh`). Each vendored file carries an inline attribution header.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) v2.1.111 or later (for Opus 4.7 support) (needed for `PreCompact` hook with `$CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_PATH`, `ConfigChange` hook, `sandbox.failIfUnavailable`).
- `jq` on your `$PATH` (for the init script's deep-merge).
- `git` on your `$PATH` (for the paper profile's upstream-sourced skill refresh; optional otherwise).
- **Scholar Gateway** claude.ai connector — enable in claude.ai account settings if using `research` or `paper` profiles.

## What's in the template

### Base `.claude/` (shipped to every profile)

- `settings.json` — permissions (wildcard allow with bare tool names + 62-entry deny list including `Edit`/`Write` to sensitive paths), sandbox (OS-level enforcement, `failIfUnavailable: true`), plugins (8 baseline), hooks (SessionStart / ConfigChange / PreCompact / SessionEnd), env (`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB=1`, `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1`), `effortLevel: xhigh` + `verbose: true` tuned for Opus 4.7 agentic work.
- `CLAUDE.md` — project-conventions stub. Each profile appends a `CLAUDE.append.md` overview on init.
- `rules/` — three base rules: `autonomous-work.md`, `pr-discipline.md`, `project-conventions.md`.
- `audit.log` — committed to git; `ConfigChange` hook appends a line on every `.claude/*` modification.
- `session-reports/` — session transcripts and git-state snapshots from `PreCompact` / `SessionEnd` hooks.

### Post-init leftovers

- `refresh-skills.sh` — re-fetch upstream-sourced skills (currently: `humanizer` in the paper profile).

### Escape hatch

- `~/.claude/settings.local.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) — merge with base at load time. Per-project `allow`/`ask`/`deny` overrides and hook activations live here.

## Updating the template or debating decisions

All design research, empirical data, and decision rationale live in a companion repo: [agentic-repo-template-research](https://github.com/groundnuty/agentic-repo-template-research) (private). Before changing the template, read the research there.
